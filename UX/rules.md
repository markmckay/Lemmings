~CONTROLS~

SELECT BUTTON: (little one at the bottom) will allow you to open the 
	following menu:

	Finish (permitted once enough lemmings have exited safely)
	Restart (quick way to end it and start again if you know its not 
		going to happen)
	Quit (selecting this will give all the lemmings on the level a bomb
		and kill 
		them off simultaneously) 
	Continue (as this menu also pauses the game)

START BUTTON: (next to the select) this is a nice way to pause the game 
		while having access to scroll along the level and/or 
		changing tools. 

LEFT/RIGHT TRIGGER: to scroll along the tools at the bottom of the screen

TRIANGLE BUTTON: zoom in/zoon out

CIRCLE BUTTON: fast forward

X BUTTON: when the crossfire hairs are aligned with a lemming it will turn 
		in to a box, this button “gifts” the selected lemming with 
		whatever tool is selected at the bottom of the screen 

SQUARE BUTTON: to lock on to a lemming, this is useful when they are 
		tightly bundled together and you need to know which way 
		their going. 

DIRECTIONAL PAD: controls the crossfire hair/selector box

ANALOGE STICK: scrolls the screen without moving the crossfire 
		hair/selector box
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


~TOOLS~

CLIMBER: looks like a lemming hugging a tree
	This one will give the lemming orange hair and the ability to 
	climb vertical surfaces.

FLOATER: looks like an umbrella
	If selected the lemming will receive an umbrella and be able to 
	fall from a great height without splat-ing (read: dieing) 

BOMBER: looks like a blue cannon ball bomb with a wick (alight) 
	The selected lemming will have a count down from five above his 
	head, once the numbers reach one, he will clutch his head and cry 
	and explode quite graphically in bite sized pixel chunks. 

BLOCKER: looks like a lemming doing the Egyptian
	This will turn the selected lemming in to a flow block, normally 
	he can be considered as good as dead once in this state, however, 
	if you mine next to said lemming he will stop blocking and just 
	walk away. The blocker will only block a horizontal flow of 
	lemmings, if he is situated on a steep slope (read: steeper than 
	mine shaft) he may be ignored.

BUILDER: looks like three bricks
	The selected lemming will be gifted with a yellow backpack and 
	build a slow but sound staircase of precisely 12 blocks this goes 
	about 6 lemmings wide (placed side by side with arms out) in a 20 
	degree incline upon laying his 10th block there will be a visual 
	cue of “CHINK” this will remain till the last block upon which he 
	will stand on and shrug, this is a visual cue to re-select said 
	lemming to carry on building or he will simply walk over the edge 
	of his structure and carry on. 

BASHER: looks like a lemming punching rocks
	This can only be gifted to a lemming situated close (read: 1 
	lemmings width) away from a near vertical surface. He will rotate 
	his arms and eat away in a horizontal path though wood, rock and 
	stairs built by lemmings. He can not plow though metal. He may 
	take one chunk out of metal, but will turn around in disgust and 
	walk away. This one chunk cannot be repeated.

DIGGER: looks like a spade
	Selected lemmings will throw up dust with gusto and create a 
	vertical shaft though wood, rock and stairs but not metal. If 
	done on the “ground” of most levels they will likely unearth 
	water and drown. However if done from a great height this will 
	save them from dieing but does not mean the remain lemming coming 
	though this vertical shaft will survive. 

MINER: looks like a pick/hammer
	Selected lemmings will acquire a yellow hard hat and a pick he 
	will swing wildly at a near horizontal surface and create a 
	downward incline of approx 20 degrees he can hack away though 
	wood, rock and stairs again he may unearth water at the ground 
	level and cause everyone behind him to drown. 

You are also given the option of increasing/decreasing the drop (read: 
	birth) rate of lemmings with the plus and minus buttons however 
	the rate cannon be decreased in a lot of levels. This is not an 
	essential tool for winning but occasionally the allotted time 
	will not be enough for all the lemmings to enter the level, and
	if you use this at the start completing the level in time becomes 
	less of a nail biting ordeal.  

-----------------------------------FUN--------------------------------


~ORGINAL LEVELS~


Title: Just Dig
Fun: 01/30
Begin with: 10
Must save: 10
Time: 7 Min 
Difficultly: 1/10
	One should be able to duce even with the lowest perception level 
	the lemmings must dig to survive the fall. So start at the closest
	point to the exit and dig away, select each lemming as they 
	approach. 

Title: Only Floaters Can Survive This
Fun: 02/30
Begin with: 10 
Must save: 08
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 1/10
	Again this is pretty straight forward just gift all the lemmings 
	with the “floating” ability as they enter. Otherwise they will 
	“SPLAT” once they fall it’s a brisk stroll to the exit. 

Title: Tailor Made For Blockers
Fun: 03/30
Begin with: 50
Must save: 05
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 2/10
	Although you are allocated bombs there is really no need for them.
	As the lemming enter block to the right of the entry “drop” let 
	them walk across the next platform drop to the smallest of the 
	platforms block of the end of this platform, the lemmings will 
	turn around and drop again. Block again in the middle of the 
	second to last platform. Lastly block off the far side of the 
	last platform this will send the lemmings cascading down to the 
	exit but you’ll have to block again for the lemmings turn around 
	to exit. 

Title: Now Use Miners And Climbers 
Fun: 04/30
Begin with: 10
Must save: 10
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 1/10
	No strategy involved in this one, just mine thru the top platform.
	As the lemmings drop “gift” with “climbing” ability they should 
	go straight up the wall to the exit. 

Title: You Need Bashers This Time
Fun: 05/30
Begin with: 50 
Must save: 05
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 2/10
	Provided with more than enough “bashers” this is a breeze. Smash 
	through the pipe then the crystal encrusted rock wall walk over 
	the first apex bash though the netting at the base of the first 
	triangle the lemmings will leapfrog just carry on a relatively 
	horizontal path to the exit. 

Title: A Task For Blockers and Bombers
Fun: 06/30
Begin with: 50 
Must save: 10
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 2/10
	Mark the first lemming to drop out with a bomb, it will explode 
	somewhere along the top platform, creating a hole for the rest of 
	the lemmings to fall thru. There is a wooden wall in the middle 
	of the path. Set up a “blocking lemming” at the wall mark him 
	with the bomb and wait till he explodes the rest of the lemmings 
	will walk on to the exit. 

Title: Builders Will Help You Here
Fun: 07/30
Begin with: 50 
Must save: 25
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 2/10
	Here one will tackle common obstructions. We begin with a low 
	wall; start your first set of steps just before the faint crease 
	in the rocks below the low wall. This should mean you only have 
	to build one set of steps. Next the “gap” start the steps at the 
	edge of this well. The majority of the lemmings will cruise on to 
	exit. However if you feel the need to rescue each and every last 
	lemming you may feel like building a set of zig-zagging steps out 
	of the well. (This is not necessary to succeed) 

Title: Not As Complicated As It Looks
Fun: 08/30
Begin with: 100 
Must save: 95
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 1/10
	Use the first lemming as a block, this will turn around the flow 
	of lemmings into the exit, ignore the rest of the tools obtained. 

Title: As Long As You Try Your Best
Fun: 09/30
Begin with: 100
Must save: 90
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 3/10
	There is a likely chance that one will lose a few lemmings here, 
	but not to worry. Just bash your way thru the pillar towards the 
	exit, there will be a few who turn around to wards the morbid 
	exposed blades, just try to catch the first “turn around” lemming 
	and use him as a block to turn the rest around. Even if you don’t 
	manage this task you should be able to “succeed”

Title: Smile If You Love Lemmings
Fun: 10/30
Begin with: 20 
Must save: 10
Time: 7 Min 
Difficultly: 2/10
	The lemmings have to far of a jump to reach the exit (and will go 
	splat without assistance) so block off the right edge of the block
	you fall upon as far to the end as possible, this will give you 
	the optimum working space, next gift all incoming lemmings with 
	“floating” ability this should see them to the bottom with out a 
	gruesome end and since they are faced the right way no other 
	tampering is needed to guide them to the exit. 

Title: Keep your hair on Mr. Lemming 
Fun: 11/30
Begin with: 60 
Must save: 50
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 2/10
	A great big grey monolith stands between you and the exit, it’s 
	marked with one	way arrows, these stop you from burrowing though
	this from the direction you enter. Select your first two lemmings
	with climbing ability, then floating. They will climb over and 
	land on the otherside of the blockage. Use the first one of the 
	pair as a blocker and as the other one returns to the block bash 
	your way though the block. Once he's a fairway though blowup your 
	blocking lemming. On ward march to the exit with only one 
	sacrifice. 

Title: Patience 
Fun: 12/30
Begin with: 80 
Must save: 40
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 1: 3/10 - 2: 4/10
	Here you have one of two options, METHOD 1) which I like better 
	for its simplicity. As the lemmings drop in close succession 
	select the first twenty with climbing ability, as soon as you’ve 
	finished that process select the floating ability or else its all 
	gone to waste. Wait a full lemming height between the last orange 
	haired lemming climbs up the wall before bashing the wall down. 
	Bash your way across select as many lemmings as you can to help… 
	if their bashing they are not turning around and dieing. Once the 
	remaining lemmings fall in to the well, build zigzagging steps 
	out of the well and home safely, select the builder by checking
	which way he's facing with the square button

	METHOD 2) so this is harder and a little more work but good 
	practice none the less. (you will need this skill) do the same 
	to begin selecting the first twenty to be super lemmings, and the 
	rest of the minions bashing their way across… once in the well 
	instead of building a series of steps out, just before the last 
	two orange haired lemmings exit, block the second to last one and 
	the last one should turn around, as he does select the pick 
	(mining) and line up your crossfire with the left edge of the 
	horizontal block above and dig a tunnel so that its low enough 
	for the lemmings to step up in to but not to low that he keeps 
	digging though the floor. Once he starts digging blow up the 
	blocking lemming quickly. A beginner might feel the need to pause 
	between each step to find the correct space and tool. 

Title: We all fall down
Fun: 13/30
Begin with: 10 
Must save: 10
Time: 4 Min
Difficultly: 1/10
	It doesn’t get much simpler than this, select each lemming with 
	the digging ability, but just make sure the lemmings reach as far 
	as they can go before digging and falling otherwise you might 
	find out you’ve run out of landing room. For some reason they 
	don’t go splat if they’ve dug the hole. But this rule doesn't
	always stand true.


Title: Origins and Lemmings
Fun: 14/30
Begin with: 80 
Must save: 60 
Time: 8 Min
Difficultly: 5/10
	The trick is just to keep of track of what needs doing and 
	weather its being done. So the first lemming to reach the first 
	pillar is put on mining duty, make sure its mining, as bashing 
	may cause lemmings to go splat. Once he's all the way though take 
	him and his next in line to be climbers. The third in line will 
	then be put on building task. Start a set of steps on the crease 
	between the 3rd and 4th block (floor) as the steps are started 
	the climbers will have reached the next step. Start mining away 
	on the third pillar the second man will have turned around and 
	started to head back towards the pack, but catch him before he 
	climbs his way out of this section and get him to start mining 
	too (away from the exit) the lemming mining the third pillar 
	should next start a set of steps this time in the middle of the 
	third block (counting away from the entry point) he will need two 
	lots of stairs once he's finished he will climb in to the last 
	section (elevated) make him a blocker and select another two 
	climbers (make sure they are a fair amount of space apart and are 
	headed towards the exit) the first guy will turn around at the 
	blocker and start mining the second to last pillar, once he's 
	started blow up the blocker the second guy should come along now 
	and start mining the last pillar… there is a wee bit of thinking 
	involved however this is a guaranteed way to not run out of time. 

Title: Don’t let your eyes deceive you
Fun: 15/30
Begin with: 100 
Must save: 80
Time: 11 Min
Difficultly: 3/10
	Time to practice the “long step, building technique”. So bash 
	your way though the 3 pillars wait till the lemmings are at the 
	top of the steps each time for obvious reasons. Once at the foot 
	on the exit side of the 3rd pillar. Make the second lemming a 
	blocker. Don’t worry their not going anywhere, the first guy will 
	become very good at building consecutive steps (hopefully) seeing 
	as he needs to build 4 one after the other without falling in. 
	catch him before he walk downwards in to the crevasse but at the 
	very edge. If you do it to early the steps will need to be to 
	long which means to high which means lemmings go splat. Just make 
	sure your cursor is always on him once he goes clink, clink, 
	clink your crossfire will turn in to a aiming square and you can 
	select him again, you have a fairly small margin of error. After 
	building the fourth one, he will fall and start climbing the 
	wooden (pre built steps) however there is yet another gap to fill 
	this time over a hang-man (/lemming) device (which sucks up your 
	oblivious lemming by the toes and cranks him over for a out of 
	view splat) you will need two lots of steps to cover this gap 
	start anywhere on the platform, the edge is the best but it 
	doesn’t really matter. The steps will eventually meet up with 
	the wooden ones, that lead up to the exit. 

Title: Don’t do anything too hasty
Fun: 16/30
Begin with: 80 
Must save: 50
Time: 11 Min
Difficultly: 4/10
	Yet another steps building exercise. This time use the second in 
	line as a blocker, make the first in line start building steps, 
	make sure it’s at the very edge of the brick platform. Now as 
	he's building go back to the drop point, where the third lemming 
	out will have gone beyond the point where the lemmings fall out 
	and on to the platform, make him a blocker too. You will make a 
	little cache of “safe” lemmings here. As long as you have two 
	lemmings blocking either side of the drop point your good to go. 
	Once that’s done the step building lemming now has your undivided 
	attention. He will need to build 6 set of stairs consecutively. 
	Not an impossible task but a tough one with a bit of practice it 
	should become second nature. As soon as his stairs overlaps the 
	exit platform you can bomb your blocker. If your really skilled 
	and want to get it over and done with quickly, you may wish to 
	increase your drop rate you have plenty of waiting time between 
	each step. 

Title: Easy when you know how
Fun: 17/30
Begin with: 50
Must save: 20
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 1/10 or 3/10
	You can either just copout and rescue the twenty that is needed 
	to complete or rescue 	the better part of the population with 
	not much more effort. I’ll start with the copout. You have twenty 
	floaters and you need to rescue 20, that seems nice and easy, and 
	rightfully so it is. So simply bash your way though the pillar 
	closest to the exit and float twenty down the drop which is to 
	much, ignoring all the lemmings dieing down the bottom. Who 
	cares? You only need the twenty anyways. But if you wish to save 
	the other ones since you’re a humane kinda person, then build 
	steps over the crushing device… you see the crusher is activated 
	by a lemming stepping on the trigger pad beneath the pounding 
	part. Once the steps are in place then plow your way through the 
	three pillars away from the exit (leaving the last one intact) 
	this will send all those lemmings in the opposite direction away 
	from the exit, but not splatting them. They will then walk over 
	the triggers and in to the exit. 

Title: Let’s block and blow
Fun: 18/30
Begin with: 70
Must save: 50
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 2/10
	The idea is that you block where you want your lemmings to fall 
	by blowing up the blocker. Fairly simple task. However be 
	cautious that you do it in that order, blocking then blowing…. 
	Also being careful to not put two holes right under each other 
	since the lemmings falling though both holes in one go will 
	splat to their pixely death. Also to be cautious where you block, 
	you don’t want to block to close to the vertical wall, you might 
	find that radius of damage the bomb does is more than you had 
	expected. So for that reason pick the middle of each empty space. 

Title: Take good care of my Lemmings 
Fun: 19/30
Begin with: 100
Must save: 70
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 2/10
	So I'm a tad pedantic when it comes to saving as many lemmings 
	as possible, so therefore I will use the second and the third 
	lemmings to drop as blocks and create a cache of nice safe little 
	lemmings. (simply block either side of the attic doors…. I also 
	recommend increasing the drop rate as you may find that you run 
	out of time on this one. So once the first lemming reaches the 
	last arc (closest to the exit) make him start building steps on 
	the middle of the large block second one away from the centre 
	brick with the pretty flower decal it’s the one almost the same 
	size, this means you only need to build three sets of consecutive 
	steps in order to make it to the door, and you wont be so high 
	that the lemmings go splat. Once you have commissioned the third 
	set go back and blow up the blocker closest to the exit.

Title: We are not at LEMCON ONE
Fun: 20/30
Begin with: 50
Must save: 30
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 2/10
	To make things less stressful, again make the cache of lemmings 
	using the second and third lemmings out to block either side of 
	the drop. But be wary to make sure that the exit side isn’t to 
	close to the step builder. The first lemming will be the set up 
	lemming. Build a set of steps to overlap the gap to the wooden 
	structure and plow though the seven wooden poles be sure to have 
	good timing, you don’t want him turning around because he's not 
	coming back, if he does decide to make a run for it simply use 
	him at a blocker in the little overlapping part of the steps 
	built to bridge the gap. Build yet another set of steps to bridge 
	the gap on the exit side, blow up the exit side blocker for the 
	cache when your good and ready. 


Title: You Live and Lem
Fun: 21/30
Begin with: 100
Must save: 60
Time: 11 Min
Difficultly: 2/10
	So the stage is set in the side section view of a dinosaur 
	fossil, how clever. Lets not complicate things, you only need 
	two bashers and one builder. That’s it, forget the rest. Bash 
	your way though the spine (the first wall with bits of bone) of 
	this creature walk out his tummy cavity to the ground floor, bash 
	though his hand the second wall with bits of bone, atchung. 
	There is a snap trap on the floor of this level below the jaw 
	of this fossil. You will only see a little metal block and what 
	looks like a giant staple. The sides of this device will spring 
	up when stepped upon and snap your lemming in two. Simply build 
	a set of steps over this device and walk on to the exit. 

Title: A Beast of a level
Fun: 22/30
Begin with: 100
Must save: 80
Time: 11 Min
Difficultly: 3/10
	I'm going to suggest making a cache of lemmings using the second 
	and third lemmings out to block either side of the drop but you 
	can choose to only block on the side away from the exit, but you 
	might find that this gets annoying when you start building steps. 
	Anyhow, bash your way though the six tree (stumps) build a set of 
	steps starting in the middle of the root towards the exit. You 
	will hit the giant rock the exit sits upon. (about a little under 
	halfway up) as the lemming turns around make him start another 
	set of steps this time going away from the exit, you will need 
	two consecutive sets in order to hit the tree as he turns around 
	yet again (to face the exit) build three more sets of consecutive 
	steps (making a zigzag of steps between tree and rock) this 
	should lead you well over the edge of the rock. Quickly scroll 
	back and blast your exit side blocker if you have two blockers. 

Title: I’ve lost that Lemming feeling
Fun: 23/30
Begin with: 80
Must save: 20
Time: 11 Min
Difficultly: 3/10
	You’ll find that this is a fairly simple level caching lemmings 
	or not. I don’t bother since you only need to save twenty out of 
	eighty. So use the first lemming to drop as a blocker (to turn 
	your lemming around walking towards the exit) the second to 
	bash his way though, the trick here is to wait till he's up in 
	to the recess of the vertical wall, this way you will start a 
	little higher and end up a little higher, so you have more room 
	for error and don’t need to click on as many bashers. You will 
	stop at holes in the “wall” but sometimes he will carry on 
	bashing (depending on where he started) either way you will come 
	to the second to last hole, this is a long hole where your 
	lemmings may perish upon falling. So build a set of steps across 
	this one, this can be tricky but you will need to learn this 
	skill, as soon as he's about to run out of wall select builder 
	the lemming will start building immediately, but before he hits
	the other side and turns around make him start bashing again 
	the trick is to not have a gap here, even a small gap will lead 
	the rest of the lemmings to their doom. Bash though to the last 
	slot bash again to the exit. 

Title: Konbanwa Lemming san
Fun: 24/30
Begin with: 30
Must save: 20
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 2/10
	So we encounter the block with the one way bashing allowed. 
	Seeing as the lemmings come out in quick succession it makes the 
	level quite easy. Select one of the last lemmings to dig (but 
	make sure he's going to land far enough before the one way block)
	he will land going the opposite direction of the pack here he 
	can bash his way though the special rock and free the rest of 
	the lemmings. Who will then cascade down to the next platform

	Once you reach the other side immediately start building some

There are lots of effective ways to do this level, but I prefer the 
	following, seeing as consecutive stairs can get tedious to build. 
	So I make the first three in line floaters and climbers and the 
	fourth a stopper (a few steps out of the drop point. The first two 
	will reach the bottom where there is a gap between the two logs. 
	Bridge this, if you start at the very edge of the log you will only 
	need one set of stairs each (they will all need to build) while 
	this is happening, the rest of your lemmings will be falling in 
	to a safe little cache on the other side of the mountain they are 
	happy staying here for a while. Back to the setup team, the third 
	in line will keep building steps all the way to the mountain wall 
	but the other two will head up the side of the wall and to the 
	exit. Block the first one just outside of the exit the next will 
	spin round and start in the opposite direction (back to the drop 
	point) get him to start mining somewhere in the white patch of 
	rock, the builder will have hit the edge of the rock (and turned 
	around once he reaches the opposite wall get him to start bashing 
	to free the cache) and so you will know where your tunnel needs to 
	be once your miner is horizontal to the steps start bashing your 
	steps will lead in to the tunnel and out to the exit don’t forget 
	to blow up your blocker before the crowd gets to him.

	Plenty of resources here, there are many ways to get the job done

	on a block at the next platform, and into the cavity, I suggest 
	selecting one as a climber to set up the rest of the level, as he 
	reaches the top of the block get him to build some steps to the 
	next platform. Bash your way though the block on the opposite end
	of this platform. He will land on the last floating plank, closet 
	to the exit. At this point you may wish to start building a set of
	steps out for the rest of the lemmings. The set up lemming will 
	start building a set of steps spanning the height and width over 
	the block and the gap to the exit.

	So its all about spacing. First lemming out blocks at the edge of 
	the first pillar, next lemming in line will be setting up and 
	building A LOT of steps. Third lemming should be a blocker a 
	little on the exit side of the drop, make sure he's not to close 
	to the step builder as that would be bad when you go to blow him 
	up to free him from his duty. Now the trick to completing this 
	level is that you want the steps to cover the gap and only the 
	gap, but not for the lemming to bounce back in the opposite 
	direction. So start a few lemmings width in from each edge, repeat 
	this 6 times over to the last pillar, as soon as you can start 
	digging without falling out the lip of the pillar do so, but only 
	to the first orange line, here start bashing as soon as he's a 
	few scoops over start digging again, this time aim to stop at the 
	top of the green line, start bashing across, a few scoops and 
	start digging, this time as far down as the last two and next 
	start bashing to exit the pillar, you should be a decent way down 
	the pillar (over half way down) as soon as your basher scoops 
	out the last few pixels start building a set of steps to overlap 
	the gap and onto the exit. At which time you can free the cache 
	by blowing up the blocker between the drop point and the exit.

	I know your given stoppers in your tool box but where are the 
	bombs to free what their holding back? So here’s my suggestion. 
	Forget about using the blockers. Bridge the gap of lava by 
	building a set of steps, ignore the few lemmings that fall to 
	their doom. The lemmings will reach the far brick wall and bounce 
	back here build another bridge to meet at the top of the first 
	set of steps, this will make an A shape above the gap and make 
	sure no lemmings will die, no matter what. Next building a set 
	of steps starting in the middle of the metal pillar beneath the 
	floor, you will need two consecutive steps to hit the brick wall, 
	when the lemmings turn around on the stairs start building from 
	the middle you will need another two consecutive steps to overlap
	to the next level. You will have created an inverted y shape of 
	steps, do the same again to bridge the next to platforms. So in 
	depth start at the exit side edge of the drop point, hit the brick 
	wall start about six steps down from the top (once they turn 
	around) overlap to the next level, next start under the drop side 
	of the exit once turned around start in the middle of this set of 
	stairs (you may need two consecutive sets) next bridge the small 
	gap between the floor and the brick wall, start close to the gap. 
	Once they turn around start building at the first notch in the 
	wooden floor plank, you will need two set of consecutive steps 
	now the herd will flow to the exit.

	The Lemmings fall out and head right to the dip in the floating

	the first one a few steps out. Letting the second do all the set 
	up and using the third to block a few steps away from the drop, 
	so you have a neat little cache under the drop point you may 
	speed up the drop rate anytime now. The set up lemming will then 
	bridge the gap if your smart and have good timing you only need 
	one set of steps, but don’t fret if your yellow school bus 
	special, you have plenty of tools at your disposal. Next he will 
	fall, not an issue, its not deep enough. He will hit the wall 
	and spring back towards the exit, bash though the one way rock, 
	and bridge the gap, here you might find it useful to start down 
	the slope a little and use three consecutive stairs to cover it, 
	once you’re half way on the stairs free the lemmings who have a 
	nice clear path to the exit.

	Oh tricky, tricky… they’ve got two drops here, but you start with 
	seeing the “wrong” one. As soon as it starts you need to scroll 
	to the other side (right) and block the first one out before he 
	falls. Next scroll back block the first lemming out of the drop 
	point where you began before he falls over the edge (he will have 
	walked along bumped in to the rock and turned around and walked 
	some more. So you have plenty of time) Now catch the next lemming 
	to be close to the wall to do some bashing on each side, so you 
	now have two bashers going towards the same direction. At some 
	point block the next lemming in line on each side. So you have 
	two lemming caches either side of the exit. The two bashing 
	lemmings will be though and then on to building some steps, be 
	aware not to start last minute you need to be several lemming 
	widths in from the edge on each side (more so on the left hand 
	side of the exit) build two sets of consecutive stairs. They will 
	reach the pillars on each side of the exit, here start another 
	set of stairs, If you’re smart you’ll only need the one set. 
	Once you’ve started on these free the cache by blowing up the

So its about placement, and knowing how to build a very long set of 
	stairs (which is more or less timing and paying attention) so 
	block the third lemming out after he's turned around and walked 
	past the drop point, the first and second will keep wandering. 
	Now block the first one as soon as he gets close to the edge 
	(gap) the second will spring around and head back towards the drop 
	point. Get him to start building some stairs I like to start 
	anywhere between the “chink” in the ground and the exit side edge 
	of the broken pillar (up top) you will need to build a very long 
	set of steps, all the way to the wall above the drop point, and 
	this is the reason why you’ve cached your lemmings in at the 
	beginning… its so long and tall that once you get to a certain 
	point (about half way) your lemmings will no longer just walk 
	past the builder and plop back on the ground, they will splat… a 
	lot of them… anyways once you’ve hit the wall bash your way though 
	the two brick pillars on the way to the exit. Between the two 
	bashing sessions you might like to free your trapped lemmings, 
	its tempting just to blow up the blocker, but then they all fall 
	down in to the abyss beneath the ground as is not very thick at 
	all. So using the square button find a lemming that is going

	Its more a matter of patience than anything else. there are two 
	ways to do this, the smart way and the normal way. Ill start with 
	the normal way, select the first lemming out with the parachute 
	and climbing ability (you might find pausing helpful) and all the 
	subsequent lemmings with the parachute ability. As soon as the 
	first one gets to the end of the platform, build a set of steps 
	that overlap to the exit platform. (normally only one, but if you 
	started to early you might need two consecutive stairs) as soon as
	you’ve started on the stairs scroll back and select each lemming 
	going towards the exit with the climbing ability keep in mind 
	there are lots of continually falling lemmings and each one needs 
	to be floatable. Once the back log is cleared the rest is nice 
	and easy rhythmic selecting to get the rest in shape for the end. 
	Now if your not very patient and select the lemmings going the 
	wrong way with the climbing ability you might like to bash half
	way though the brick on the opposite side of the well. 
	Now the smart persons way is to select the first one with climbing 
	and floating ability, the next with floating and wait till he 
	turns around at the bottom at the well before selecting climbing 
	and same with the third one, the second one becomes a blocker and 
	the third builds a set of stairs at the foot of the blocker. Keep 
	in mind the first on out will need to start building some stairs 
	on the end of the platform as above and there will always be pesky 
	little lemmings falling and needing attention too now as soon as 
	your two steps are built you can clear the backlog (selecting the 
	ones trapped in the well with climbing ability) and all you have 
	to do from now on is make sure all the lemmings out have floating 
	ability its not that much harder in fact I think its less work in 
	total, its just a little bit more to begin with.

	build in the opposite direction up and over the drop point to the 
	floating steel pillar. Drop on to the pillar build another set of 
	several consecutive steps to overlap the next floating pillar, 
	which has the little wooden ledge sticking out the top. From here 
	the lemmings will fall on to the floating wooden platform at the

	set up pair. Block the first in line to the exit. But make sure 
	to block where you can blow up with out making a gap where 
	lemmings will fall. Use the free set up lemming to bash though 
	the one way wall. Blow up the blocking lemming between the wall 
	and the exit.

	Well at least you have plenty of tools. So start bashing where 
	the lemmings will other wise turn around, the higher up the 
	inside the better, block the next one. Once the set up lemming 
	is though get him to start building some steps to the next 6 you 
	might need two set of stairs. To the wall now bash your way though
	to the inside. Fall down and walk across the inside of the middle 
	6. bash though the exit side same as the first time build another 
	set of step to the final six (with the exit inside) bash though 
	the final wall to reach the exit blow up the blocker holding back 
	the cache.

	So if you select two lemmings to blow up at the same location one 
	will be a little further than the other. Ideally you will have a 
	slightly slanted crater, one where lemmings will fall in and turn 
	around at the far wall and walk right out again. So as the first 
	two fall out select them as bombs (keep your cursor in the same 
	place) if need be, place some stairs going back towards the exit 
	to entice the lemmings to walk out of the crater.  

Title: From The Boundary Line
Tricky: 23/30
Begin with: 100
Must save: 60
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 8/10
	So if you haven’t learnt the turn around trick you’d better do so 
	now. Start by selecting the first 10 with climbing and floating 
	ablitly (you might like to use the pause if your not lightning 
	quick) now count another five select this next one with the 
	square button, as soon as he reaches the wall get him to start 
	bashing, and the guy next to him (or whatever you can get your 
	cursor on) the “special group” with orange hair and umbrellas will 
	be falling down the other side of the block and falling in to the 
	well, at the same time as the “rest of them” the only difference 
	is that “the special group” will climb out and in to the exit, 
	before they all disappear catch the last one as close to the exit 
	door as possible with the digging ability get him to turn around 
	(by digging two thirds of a lemmings height and then building a 
	ladder in the hole which will turn him around) line up your cursor 
	with the inside edge of the block hanging above (middle of the 
	wooden plank) get him to start mining from here he will then free 
	the lot but die in the process.

Title: Tightrope City
Tricky: 24/30
Begin with: 80
Must save: 75 
Time: 3 Min
Difficultly: 6/10
	Using the second and the third block each side of the drop point 
	the second lemming wants to be as far as the end of the house in 
	the back ground and the third one just doesn’t want to fall off 
	the edge. Now the first becomes a set up lemming who will build 
	two consecutive stairs to reach the final platform, he needs to 
	start in the crease of the wood planks beneath him, (where the 
	first plank meets the next). Here’s the trick because blowing up 
	the blockers isn’t recommended, as all the lemmings will fall 
	though the floor. So find a lemming (with the square button) 
	going towards the exit, get him to start building his stairs, if 
	you’ve marked the blocker at the exit side of the house in the 
	back ground, make the building lemming start under the drop (on 
	the exit edge). The cache will cascade over the blocker and walk 
	in a tightly packed bunch to the exit. Be aware you don’t have 
	much time so you need to execute the last set of stairs as soon 
	as the set up lemming has started on the second lot of steps to 
	the exit.

Difficultly: 4/10
	Boo Hoo, there’s gonna be a lot of carnage. Well you only need 
	ten. So select the first one with parachute, he will fall with no 
	side effects (unlike the rest who will splat.) go up the next set 
	of steps where once he reaches the top and starts building some 
	steps to the next pillar the end of the line will be in site, so 
	make sure to select the last 9 with floating ability. As your set 
	up lemming reaches the next pillar get him to bash his way though
	when he reaches the end of this pillar make another set of steps 
	to overlap the platform with the exit, don’t worry about the 
	height, the lemmings that reach this point will all have umbrellas
	anyway. 

Title: I have a cunning plan

Difficultly: 3/10
	Oh dear, there are the spinning blades and you must save 100% 
	okay so the first one out will be a basher a little later on so 
	let him go ahead, but from the second onwards get them to start 
	building some steps. Get everyone until your step building tools 
	run out. By the time you’ve run out to make builders your set up 
	lemming will have reached the wall get him to bash, the rest will 
	follow when their good and ready. Nice and safe in one piece.

Title: The Island of the Wicker people
Tricky: 27/30

Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 5/10
	The first one out must start digging the second one out will walk 
	over the first and out his pit and get him to start mining 
	(diagonally) once the first pit gets a fair way get him to bash 
	across to the diagonial shaft, from here they will fall out, and 
	normally one will fall out headed to wards the water, the rest 
	towards the one way rock, select three (randomly) fairly spaced 
	lemmings as climbers, get them to walk over the one way mountain, 
	use the first in line as a blocker, select him on the skull and 
	the other two will walk towards the exit, get the second one to 
	build two consecutive stairs from the nose of the skull to the 
	exit platform (above) and get the first (that turned around to 
	bash though the one way mountain. The cache will be set free. 

Title: Lost something?
Tricky: 28/30
Begin with: 100
Must save: 90
Time: 7 Min
Difficultly: 4/10
	Well at first you kinda scratch your head and ask WHERE is the 
	exit??!?! Well its quite obvious there are two rocks each on a 
	metal platform one with an open eye pattern (far side) and one 
	with a half closed eye pattern (closest to the drop point) the 
	latter contains the exit, within the rock! Yes your going to have 
	to bash your way though the rock to get to the exit. So here’s 
	what I suggest as the plan. First lemming to go up the tree trunk 
	pillar to the open eye rock will turn around and head back down 
	the trunk. Catch him half way down the trunk and get him to start 
	building. Build two consecutive stairs, make sure that the rest 
	(headed back to the drop point) don’t fall in the water, just 
	keep an eye out and make sure you block just after the drop point. 
	As soon as your building lemming hits the rock on the other side 
	get him to bash though the wall he will get to the middle and you 
	will see the exit. The rest of the lemmings will get sucked right 
	in to it, but you have the option of stopping the basher by 
	getting him to build once he's unearthed the exit. 

Title: Rainbow Island
Tricky: 29/30
Begin with: 100
Must save: 99
Time: 6 Min
Difficultly: 7/10
	Its never easy to save 99%. And I'm sure there are a many methods 
	to the madness of solving this level. But here’s the sure fire way.
	so you start with three drop points. Your camera begins on the 
	bottom one, you need to scroll up to the highest the second one 
	out must start digging after he takes a step or two, but the first 
	one out will be a set up get him to dig once he gets over the block
	where the grassy bit is (ie, anywhere where he will land in the 
	next “sector”) the rest of the lemmings will fall down the hole 
	the second one dug and in to the first sector (and importantly not 
	out) The set up lemming Who will need to dig a hole in the latter 
	half of his sector he's in now (to the one next to the cache, this 
	one has a spinning blade set inside) once he's in get him to build
	some stairs over the death contraption. I would suggest being 
	safe and starting on the middle of the second block from the
	spinner and building two consecutive stairs, up and over. 
	(however, it can be done with just one, you need to start on the 
	crease of the block that the spinner is sitting half on, and your 
	stairs will intersect the wooden pole that the blades are spinning 
	on, this isn’t recommended if you just want to clear the level as 
	it takes a fair bit of skill, but is sure is fun to do) Once he 
	drops and walks a few steps get him to mine in to the sector 
	beneath (this one has nothing in it) next get him to bash his way 
	though to wall(s) on the exit side of this sector. As he does that 
	bash your way though the exit side wall(s) back where the cache is.
	The set up lemming will need to bash though one final wall, to 
	have a clear path to the exit. 

Title: The Crankshaft
Tricky: 30/30
Begin with: 100
Must save: 90
Time: 6 Min
Difficultly: 7/10
	Time is scarce, that’s the main problem. Make the first two out as 
	climbers and floaters, get the third to start mining once he 
	reaches the pillar. The climbing pair, will be making their acsent 
	over the second pillar, once they get to the third pillar get the 
	first one to start mining, the second will walk in to the shaft to 
	be and walk back out get him to mine on the opposite pillar. 
	Meanwhile, the rest of the lemmings will have reached the down 
	section, get the first lemming to the middle where there is a 
	crease (he will be there before you start mining the third pillar) 
	of this section get him to build two consecutive set of stairs. 
	These stairs will meet up with the diagonal shaft made by the 
	second climber. The first climber will be though to the next down 
	section, get him to start building two consecutive stairs, again 
	start from the crease in the centre, while he's building you want 
	to increase your drop rate to highest setting. The next two in 
	line can be made climbers and once they get to the far pillar 
	(the one closest to the exit) get the first one to start mining 
	and the second will turn around and mine the opposite pillar, 
	which should meet up with the stairs, bear in mind to start as 
	close to the wall as possible, but if you start mining the stairs, 
	just start building, it will be in the wrong direction, but it 
	wont matter.

~FAQ~
Q: Are you going to write the rest of the levels??
A: yes i'm in the process of that, but it takes a bit of time expect it 
	due sometime later this month.

Q: Can i ask you anything?
A: sure, but you wont find the most informative answer. your prolly
